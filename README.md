# Prediction Flavoproteins EM using Voxels

This repository contains the script and data used for "Automatic features extraction from PDB files for flavoproteins redox potential prediction models"

## Flavoprotein Datset

> The Flavoproteins Dataset is available at `dataset.xlsx`, at sheet 'Foglio_backup' 
For each flavoprotein used in this work we report:

```
- PDB-ID 
- Organism and Family
- Classification and Cofactor-type
- Technique resolution
- Em, E1, E2, ùõ•E
- Cofactor (if cofactor is FMN = 1, if cofactor is FAD = 0)
- Reference of the experimental work
```
